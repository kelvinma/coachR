#CoachUp

##Statement

This project represents my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. Our project parameters were essentially wide open, with the only requirements being basic CRUD actions.

I used this as an opportunity to challenge myself as best as I could while still having access to my excellent instructors at General Assembly. I wanted to take on a challenge that I likely would not be able to accomplish with the mentorship available to me in class.

As such, I set two primary goals for myself:

* Build a project with a front-end framework, in this case EmberJS
* Implement third-party authentication with a social media platform such as Facebook, Spotify or Strava
* Use a different combination of back-end framework and database structure

In the end, my project was able to accompish two of my three primary goals. My Ember application is functional with all four CRUD actions performing on two models, and my back-end framework is Express paired with a SQL database via Sequelize.

There were several issues that came up with the Ember CRUD actions, which hindered my ability to achieve my goal of authentication.
